# Word-Generator
This Repository is used to generate all possible combinations of a certain amount of chars. 
It is possible to determine the Char-Set that should be used and set the length of the outputted words.
The calculation of the words can be done with a single thread or with multiple threads and the elapsed time can be compared.
